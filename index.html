              <h4>Recipe instructions</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Put the chicken breasts between two pieces of baking parchment
                  and use a rolling pin to gently bash them until they are
                  approximately 1cm thick. Cut each chicken breast into two even
                  pieces.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you're using a frying pan, heat two frying pans over
                  medium-high heat, with one of them containing oil. Fry the
                  chicken in the oiled pan for 3-4 mins on each side until they
                  are cooked through. Season the chicken, reduce the heat,
                  drizzle in the chilli sauce and half of the lemon juice, and
                  cook for an additional 1-2 mins until the sauce is reduced.
                  Remove the chicken from the heat.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you're using an air-fryer, preheat it to 180C for 4 mins.
                  Add the chicken to the air-fryer and cook for 12 mins. Drizzle
                  over the chilli sauce and half the lemon juice and cook for an
                  additional 1-2 mins until the chicken is cooked through and
                  the sauce is reduced. Remove the chicken and keep it warm.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While the chicken is cooking, toast the buns in the dry frying
                  pan for 30 seconds. Transfer them to a plate. If you're using
                  an air fryer, put the buns in the air fryer for 1-2 mins until
                  they are warm. Increase the air fryer temperature to 200C. Add
                  the halloumi to the air fryer basket and cook for 10 mins,
                  turning halfway through, until it's golden. Toss the cabbage
                  with the mayo and the remaining lemon juice.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Spoon the hummus (or dip of your choice) into the toasted
                  buns, then top with the rocket, chilli chicken, halloumi, and
                  peppers. Drizzle with a little more chilli sauce, spoon over
                  the cabbage, season with black pepper, and top with the bun
                  lids. Serve with any extra cabbage on the side or a green
                  salad.
